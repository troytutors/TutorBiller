We hope we were able to help you. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions.

General Notes:

- You can setup automatic billing by selecting the option to save your payment method. This will allow you to not have to manually pay for an invoice each time in the future.
- We have free office hours every Saturday and the majority of our students don’t (but should) take advantage of it. Consider getting a head start on your homework assignments by attending office hours.
- We’re hiring software engineer interns and part-time roles. Learn more at http://troytutors.com/careers
