We hope we were able to help you. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions.

General Notes:

- You can setup automatic billing by selecting the option to save your payment method. This will allow you to not have to manually pay for an invoice each time in the future.
- You can prepay for future tutoring sessions, or for others, by purchasing a gift card at https://troytutors.com/giftcard
- We have free office hours every Saturday and the majority of our students don’t (but should) take advantage of it. Consider getting a head start on your homework assignments by attending office hours.
- As you check the box when booking a session, we ask that you pay tutoring sessions within 3 days of receiving an invoice. It is important that we are able to pay all our tutors on time, and your payments are sent directly to the tutors during their days of direct deposit.
- We’re hiring software engineer interns and for part-time roles. Learn more at https://troytutors.com/careers
